**A detailed introduction will be updated after the related paper is officially published.**

Since the resource files are relatively large, **the initial loading may take some time** — please be patient.

If the fonts fail to load properly on the first attempt, please refresh the page and try again.

The current version is controlled through URL parameters:

1. **Language** – Defaults to Chinese. To switch to English, add `lang=en`.
2. **Figure type icon** – use Fig. 2 C<sub>1</sub> by default. To switch to compass icon, add `status-icon=location`.
3. **Location representation on the figure’s timeline** – use area chart by default. To replace them with coordinate icons ( Fig. 2 B<sub>6</sub> ), add `location-line=icon`.
